# Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Initialization

node index.js


## Technologies:
Node.js
MySQL
Express
Inquirer
console.table

## Usage and Acceptance Criteria
```
  As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

## Goal with this assignment

I was personally encouraged that I was able to figure out the question menu flow by breaking up the inquirer promtps and calling funcitons for menus depending on responses.
